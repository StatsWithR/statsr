Description: Provides functions and datasets to support inference with the open access book
            "An Introduction to Bayesian Thinking", available online
             <https://statswithr.github.io/book> and  online videos for the
             "Statistics with R Specialization" <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics>.  
             which includes an introduction to Bayesian inference and decision
             making for one and two sample credible intervals and 
             hypothesis testing for Gaussian and Binomial data, in addition to
             frequentist inference using model-based and randomization-based methods.
             To help with understanding concepts, 'shiny' applications are used to aide 
             visualization of sampling distributions, credible intervals, hypothesis testing, 
             Lindley's and Bartlett's paradoxes. For development versions or to report issues, please visit
