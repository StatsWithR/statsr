\description{
The data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large
sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin (variables beginning
with \code{cls}). In addition, six students rated the professors' physical
appearance (variables beginning with \code{bty}). (This is a slightly modified
version of the original data set that was released as part of the replication
data for Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models
(Gelman and Hill, 2007).
